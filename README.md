# Basic Responsive Navigation Bar

This project demonstrates a basic responsive navigation bar created using HTML and CSS.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the navigation bar.
- `style.css`: The CSS styles for the navigation bar.

## Usage

1.  Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2.  Observe the navigation bar at different screen sizes to see its responsive behavior.

## Explanation

- The HTML file uses an unordered list (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`) to create the navigation links.
- The CSS file styles the list items and links, creating a horizontal navigation bar.
- A media query is used to make the navigation bar responsive, stacking the links vertically on smaller screens.

## Customization

- You can change the navigation links by modifying the `<li>` elements in `index.html`.
- You can customize the styles by editing the `style.css` file.
- Colors and breakpoints can be changed to match your needs.
